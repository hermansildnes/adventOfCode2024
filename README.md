# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). I've also used it as an opportunity to play around with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

## Structure

The solution to each days challenge can be found in `solutions\dayX`. Each directory will contain the following files:
- `input`: The input data for the challenge.
- `input2`: The example test data for the challenge.
- `main.py`: The Python script containing the solution to part 1.
- `main2.py`: The Python script containing the solution to part 2 (for days where I completed part 2).

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script. For example, to run the solution for Day 1:

```bash
cd solutions/day01
uv run main.py
uv run main2.py

```
